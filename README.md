## Features

- NLP preprocessing (TF-IDF, tokenization)
- Model training and evaluation
- MIT-licensed and badge-enhanced
- GitHub-ready with clear project structure

## How to Run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## Dataset

Use a labeled news dataset (such as from Kaggle) and rename it to `fake_or_real_news.csv` in the project root.
